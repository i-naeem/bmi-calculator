                  The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height
                  and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.

                <p>
                  The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by
                  their height in metres squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means
                  25kg/m2.

                <p>
                  The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in
                  kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared.

            The BMI stands for Body Mass Index and it is a measure that uses
            your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. The
            BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their
            height in metres squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.

            <h2>What are <abbr title="Body Mass Index">BMI</abbr> Ranges</h2>
            <p class="fs-4">
              For most adults, an ideal
              <abbr title="Body Mass Index">BMI</abbr> is in the 18.5 to 24.9
              range.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-4">
              For children and young people aged 2 to 18, the BMI calculation
              takes into account age and gender as well as height and weight.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-0 fs-4">
              If your <abbr title="Body Mass Index">BMI</abbr> is:
            </p>
            <ul class="fs-5">
              <li>below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range</li>
              <li>
                between 18.5 and 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range
              </li>
              <li>between 25 and 29.9 – you're in the overweight range</li>
              <li>between 30 and 39.9 – you're in the obese range</li>

            <h2>Body Mass Index Accuracy</h2>
            <p class="fs-4">
              BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a
              healthy weight range for a particular height. As well as measuring
              your BMI, healthcare professionals may take other factors into
              account when assessing if you're a healthy weight. Muscle is much
              denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as heavyweight
              boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may be a healthy weight even
              though their BMI is classed as obese.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-4">
              Your ethnic group can also affect your risk of some health
              conditions. For example, adults of South Asian origin may have a
              higher risk of some health problems, such as diabetes, with a BMI
              of 23, which is usually considered healthy. You should not use BMI
              as a measure if you're pregnant. Get advice from your midwife or
              GP if you're concerned about your weight.
